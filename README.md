# E-Commerce Microservices Architecture

## Overview
This project is a highly scalable and maintainable e-commerce system built using ASP.NET Core 8, Clean Architecture, and Microservices. Each service follows domain-driven design (DDD) principles and is deployed as an independent unit, ensuring flexibility and resilience.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET 8** - Modern, high-performance framework
- **C#** - Core development language
- **Entity Framework Core** - Database ORM
- **Ocelot API Gateway** - API aggregation and routing
- **RabbitMQ** - Event-driven messaging
- **Redis** - Caching and data synchronization
- **Docker** - Containerization and deployment
- **SQL Server** - Relational database management
- **xUnit** - Unit testing framework
- **Fluent Assertions** - Assertion library for readable tests

---

## Architecture
The system follows Clean Architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:
- **API Layer**: Handles API requests
- **Application Layer**: Business logic and use cases with CQRS Pattern and Mediator Pattern
- **Domain Layer**: Core entities, aggregates, and domain services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data persistence, external services, and message brokers

### Clean Architecture Features (General Across Services, Except Shared Services & API Gateway)
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separates read and write operations for optimized performance
- **Mediator Pattern**: Centralizes request handling for loose coupling
- **AutoMapper**: Simplifies object-to-object mapping
- **Fluent Validation + Custom Error Handling Middleware**: Ensures robust input validation and error management
- **Logging with Serilog**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Dependency Injection & SOLID Principles**: Ensures maintainable and testable code
- **Generic Repository**: Reusable data access patterns
- **Fluent API**: Configures Entity Framework relationships
- **Pagination Schema**: Efficient data retrieval for large datasets
- **Localization (EN/AR Support)**: Multi-language support

## Microservices
Each service operates independently and communicates through RabbitMQ (event-driven) or HTTP APIs (via Ocelot Gateway).

### 1. Authentication Service (üîë AuthService)
- Manages user authentication and authorization
- Implements JWT & Refresh Tokens for secure access
- Handles user registration, login, and Identity & Role Management
- **Features:**
  - Email Confirmation
  - External Login With Google
  - Reset Password System
  - Change Password
  - Unit Testing with xUnit & Fluent Assertions

### 2. Product Service (üõí ProductService)
- Manages product catalog (CRUD operations)
- Stores product details, pricing, and availability
- Publishes events when product stock changes
- **Unit Testing:** xUnit with Fluent Assertions

### 3. Order Service (üì¶ OrderService)
- Processes customer orders
- Ensures payment validation before order confirmation
- Implements retry mechanisms for failed transactions
- **Unit Testing:** xUnit with Fluent Assertions

### 4. Inventory Service (üì¶ InventoryService)
- Tracks stock levels and updates product availability
- Subscribes to product stock updates from RabbitMQ
- Notifies Order Service of stock shortages
- **Unit Testing:** xUnit with Fluent Assertions

### 5. Cart Service (üõçÔ∏è CartService)
- Manages user shopping carts
- Supports session-based and persistent cart storage
- Syncs with Inventory Service to prevent stock issues
- **Unit Testing:** xUnit with Fluent Assertions

### 6. Payment Service (üí≥ PaymentService)
- Handles transactions securely
- Integrates with third-party payment gateways
- Uses RabbitMQ to notify Order Service upon successful payment
- **Unit Testing:** xUnit with Fluent Assertions

### 7. Wishlist Service (‚ù§Ô∏è WishListService)
- Allows users to save favorite products
- Syncs with Product Service for availability updates
- Uses Redis for fast retrieval
- **Unit Testing:** xUnit with Fluent Assertions

### 8. Shared Services (üîÑ SharedServices)
- Provides utilities such as logging, notifications, and email services
- Ensures cross-cutting concerns are handled consistently

---

## API Gateway (üêÜ Ocelot)
- Routes all requests to the appropriate microservices
- Implements authentication, caching, and rate-limiting
- Enhances security by preventing direct access to services

## Message Broker (üì© RabbitMQ)
- Facilitates asynchronous communication between services
- Ensures system resilience by handling event-based updates
- Used for order processing, inventory updates, and payment confirmation

## Deployment (üê≥ Docker)
- Each service runs inside a Docker container
- Docker Compose is used to manage multi-container setup
- Scalable and deployable in Kubernetes or cloud platforms

---
